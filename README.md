# llm_bias_detector
A Python tool for evaluating and analyzing bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository provides scripts and methodologies to identify, measure, and visualize bias in text generated by LLMs.

## Overview
`llm-bias-detector` is a set of Python tools designed to evaluate and analyze bias in Large Language Models (LLMs). It works by submitting multiple queries and linguistic variations of queries to different LLM's and capturing and aggregating key information in responses. It can also generate synthetic user-LLM conversational interactions for an analysis of bias in context in which LLM's are typically used. The purpose is to observe biases in LLM's based on their behaviour (as opposed to their constitution). This can be used by researchers exploring LLM bias across a range of topics including those typically of concern in AI models (race, gender, nationality, age group, political affiliation etc) as well as other topics of commercial interest like bias towards products, brands, companies product features etc. 

## Features
- Automated query submission to gpt3.5, gpt4 and llama3(8b)
- Generated synthetic conversations to extract bias in more naturalistic interactions
- Evaluation metrics to quantify bias levels
- Scripts to visualize bias trends and patterns in generated text.
- Extensible Framework: Easily extend the tool to accommodate new types of biases and evaluation metrics.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-bias-assessment.git
cd llm-bias-assessment

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To evaluate bias in your LLM, use the following command:
python assess_bias.py --model your_model_name --input your_input_file.txt
Example: python assess_bias.py --model gpt-3 --input sample_texts.txt

## Examples
